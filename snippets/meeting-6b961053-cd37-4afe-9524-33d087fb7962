## Transcript
 
Me: If it looks good. Then you would set the buck to finalize some of the great email. It's something else. I guess it sort of depends. I think those are lies. Most of what you see. As not everything needs actions. Sometimes. Like something's meant to be in there. What is the case here? I was just generally seeing things today. And I'm like, don't really know what to. Automatic. Overview process. Now. If things have been in review for a certain period of time. That's et cetera. Just letting us know that. Okay? I wanted to discuss. Mikiel's comment. Which definitely has some truth to it. But I think rethinking. The customer response. Piece. In the face of how to educate. The users. And I think right now. We should line on how we do it. And what assets we have. And then what would. Be best end state. And then. See how they transition between the two. Do we have a list of problems, like known problems right now? Or should we? I think it's known problems are just like our own intuition. Rattlesmith the dome for sure. Like high level. We are very discharged in the way that we do with YouTube generally. On call. Definitely the improvement in, like, process from our side. That probably. Experience for the user interface. Different people at basis. Should we talk about things differently? It's inconsistent messaging. System. I think there's also just like, internally on the. Don't know what exists in. Content. Is. Slow down the customer response process moving. By the way. Spent 10 minutes. You can do enough. You just want to get the answers done quickly. Compound. I will say one thing that's helpful that I think Atlas will build is that I have after every meeting. I like half the project for, like, on ChatGPT and I literally add the transcripts. Into there. And so then afterwards I can see who is the controller for, like, whatever, and it will give me all the information. But I have like the latest status and everything for each client. Interesting. Okay, that's fascinating. Kind of nice to have. And then I also have for the exact meaning, like to help us with context. Like, I mean, yet to get content. Like, if every single transcript is on there and someone is on call, like, if you input the K, this is a client. Like, what other issues that they've been facing. Do you have some context on things? Nice. And then I also have the basis academy. I only do it for. Honestly, the two points I'm on for. Because otherwise it's a lot of work for me to export every transfer each month. But then, per Basis Academy, I have the full help guide in here. So that when I write stuff scripts, it literally pulls from all of the, like, help guides. So I think if we just even ask Atlas. Like, hey, like, how do I do X, Y and Z? Or like, this is the issue I'm facing. It will give you like, okay, how about you go to this doc Ker? Yeah. Yeah. The annoying thing, though, about the ChatGPT aspect of it is that it gives you the page number and not necessarily the Cause it doesn't link to the health guide. It's just a PDF that I downloaded. Interesting. Okay. We should definitely talk about all these workflows. Customer response. Is us aligning on. What the edge cases are. And like what our product and can't do. Actually talk about that. Oh, yeah. And part of the what it. Can't do. We don't want to talk about. And some of the stuff we can't do, we actively do want to talk about it. Because it's Peaker. Yes. This is very huge one. Like, like the biggest thing that come up recently. I saw last week was explaining. How we reconcile something like build.com situation. Happened all the time. Do we want to tell people? How we integrate or don't integrate with Build. Like, I think there's just, like, a lot of nuance on how to talk about those things. That? Yeah. We can be much more strategic. When it builds on common, for instance. Like, Matt likes saying that we didn't really build.com in, like, promotional community. We, of course, don't have any actual integration. We like integrate with a ledger and therefore see build out conference actions. We like play nicely with it. So there are a lot of things like that. Where it's like we have some sort of. I don't know. Strategic interest in talking about things a certain way. Yes. And us. Second part. That got much more and build up to the agents. Like world based, I guess, generally. No, but there's a lot of places like workspaces. There were tons of workflows that user requests. I think Workspace should be able to do that once it's Obviously, it's like 5% of the things that we said. Would like. To do it well, right? Now. Yeah, that's right. Funny. That's a particular just like. My thing is, I'm mainly seeing it as a source of truth. Is what I'm hoping for. Instead of, like, scouring through pylon or slacks to try to see a similar situation, I think. I'm hoping this will be the source of truth. For every. It connects up to the code base. In theory. Yeah. Even the code base, by the way, is wrong. Like, if you ask Dev in or any of, like, it'll give you wrong answer sometimes. And, like, I know for a fact this is wrong and I'm not even. Now you're saying, like, does it do X, Y or Z? And then it'll tell you it's literally inaccurate. Really, really work up code notes. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe an aspect of this is like being. Realistic. Yeah. And I think at least R is like if. If the DI team is owning the external docs. And we can get a process where they're getting updated more frequently, either, like, through things like transcripts, but also just by humans. Then at least we can say, all right, we know that this is up to date, and then the code we can, like, do over time. Cause I'm with you. That's a bigger project. No, that's a way that you're project. But then you don't even need like if you directly, you don't even need people to upload anything. Sorry, Integrate gong with, like, the customer calls. But I'm saying integrate gong or saying with Atlas. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have everything directly, like, automatically. You know, end of day, everything gets integrated in there. That would be great. And we know who's been saying what about what the flag. And we can flag. Inconsistency. Yes. Like, I think almost like pylon go ng and slack. If we can, like, take in all. But then again, slots. Like, there's some stuff outdated. Like, I don't necessarily want you to, like, pull in, you know, like, hey, like, we can't do this. Like, this one slack set that, but now we care. So I don't miss it. Like maybe not slack. I don't, I don't know what I'm sort of thinking again. This is all. We should all work on this. But I'll say like we're kind of thinking is at least the start is it will take in different sources, information. And then create kind of pull requests. So someone on the team. We can talk about who, but we'll probably each day, like, just review all the things that the AI is doing until we get comfortable enough to say, okay, like, you could just do it, you know? And just to be clear, let's, like take Gong, for example. Is the hope that it is updating external docs. Or internal docs or, like, where. What would be the ideal situation with that, like, internal information? Like, honestly, it's more so, like, the information provided across the team. For it to be consistent is kind of what I'm thinking. And where does that live today? Truly, like, with the di lead. Okay. Like, I. There's no. I mean, we have internal toxin. What about that? Or what about those? The internal docs and get book. Is that different? Place to update. It. I don't know if we want five. Customer calls, like directly. Updating. Like I I'd be before get book. I. I get you, but more so. I'm just thinking about, like, if your uncle. And, like, the customer brings up something so you have some context. To things. That would be nice. Yes. Yeah. I think the other piece to it, which I think we can. Start stocking it better. For the on call process. Is like at the end of the day. You're just, like, close ticket. You actually have to, like, using whisper or whatever, like, write out what your triadic process was. I also think there's different information that lives in a lot of different tools. When I'm on call. And I see, like, a figure I know to go to, like, check these three things. But while I'm checking the three things, I'm also gonna ping the people that deal with it, and it just. Yeah. Yeah. Understood. Honestly, poor Elijah. Like, truly, like, yes. He's on a call down. In terms of. So these are all really good, just problems to help me understand what's going on here. In terms of. You mentioned, like, ideal state. Obviously, like, we can talk about a lot of different things here. If we were gonna say, hey, like, here's one thing that was, like, highest priority of all the things. We listed so far? Curious what everyone's like. Highest priority thing is. My hype. Something I really want to do. Which I think is slightly separate. Communication. Like relatively easy ways to start that. Pretty. Generally speaking about things. Like best practices. Eventually, like love to. Make a report across writing. Guys. So you just, like, throw it into an LLM with any message about which it's, like, standardized. Deals. Examples of people being. Is it like people being too casual? They're just being too much variation across. Yes, it's variations Sometimes. I mean, I think people often just like they're on rushing. A lot of messages, and some type of messages will just kind of sound. Bad. Exactly. Where, like, not super clear, but I think we should. Kind of give examples. If you don't let them know, they're gonna continue doing it. Yes. I think, yeah. I 'm an ad hoc basis, but. Yeah, okay, that's a good point. But I think it's reflective. Right. Coherence. That. It's also just like how we talk about things. And we talk about the same. Modules or like in terms of uses craft different things. I pat myself that all the time. Like I said, war fluid, incentive procedures. Things happen. But it's good to have some sort of mechanisms. I think, like, Gong actually does this. As part of teaching aspect for STRs. They're the way you comment on specific calls. For a misales manager. Like teaching. We could have the exact same thing. Yeah, I like that. And let me just ask on. On this one of, you know, let's just take. We take like, the same idea of let's just start with the manual way, and eventually we'll automate it. You're like, we can run a best practices doc, right? To start, people can read it and eventually they can throw into ChatGPT, and then eventually we can do something more automated. Would you imagine that? Like, would it be okay for that to live in internal docs, to put intelligence and then we throw it in there? Like, is that. Yeah. They'd be fine. I think, like, what I would like is, like, a V2 of this is like, there's some sort of, I don't know. Slack block or just like some internal out of them we have. Totally. Gonna send a message for you if you first throw it and you're like, takes us up, structure pulls in. I don't know. Consistent language from the Hellcat is generally standardized. But then I've also been told my messages to AI. So, yeah, we could do some. We can get some good style guys to make it sack human, I think, Yeah. Yeah. But I think you're right. Even how we talk about like this bank, I've disconnected being able to reconnect. Yeah. Yeah, I think within that. There's, like, eight or ten different things. To talk about. Just like how I said that. Why I said that. Yes. Yes. And when people responding to customer, when you're talking about this, is it mainly through Slack or through Pylon or through email? Well, it's pylon. It's stock by line. It's like two pylon. Yeah, but people are doing it. Like when you respond, you respond right now in the in app chat. Yeah. In time. Oh, you want a serious bond in Python. I didn't know that. Yeah, you did. I thought you wanted series one in the slack it connects the final. Okay. Got it. Okay, I'll start doing that. I got you. So it shouldn't. So it should be in paradise. Should be in ground. Because the DSR to direct which chain. Okay. I'm on call on Thursday. I'll do that. There are also, like, I definitely have a lot of DMS on Ts can't be around you. 80% pile on 20% slack dms and emails. We're increasingly pushing people. Use alice. Cool. Okay, so that's your number one standardizing communication with customers? I think so. I think. That's. Yeah, it's. I mean, it's something that I think is, like, easy to start doing. I mean, there might be other things that are not pressing to actually. Make like the other side of this is that the deputation needs to be good enough to be a source that you could rely upon. I mean, the way we've done it historically. Probably the last. Year. You join as a new hire. Sort of on the, like, non core engineering side. Your first, like, couple months are just like. You're like the leg. Docs person make sure all the hell dogs are up use of someone who's onboarding because if they can't follow with doxy, Then, no, we can't. So that's true. And I think every time someone comes in, we have that same type of thing. That dish has been like that. Always blew. I think it's largely true. But then they also are not the ones that, like, know how to make the changes to it. No, they shouldn't hear that. I think everyone. Yeah, this seems wrong, but, like, I don't actually know enough about what is right. To life like I don't make the change. Yeah, exactly. Okay? Main question. I think. There is an opportunity. In day to day interactions. To still give an answer. With health guide. Support. Like, I don't think. I don't think we're gonna get to the point in the night term where we can just send them help. Guide line. Like we still want to be personal. But, like, ideally, what we're sending them is, like, copy from the help guy, or it's a script, part of a transit from an Academy video. So we can say like, this is your question. They answer your question. You want, like, more detailed response? And like to figure out how this works the next time you have the same question. This is where you go. Just, like, reinforcing, like, mean. I don't know how you guys interact with software, but it works for me when I work with CS teams. Who always use the Help guide links. Eventually I just like learn to go there first. Yeah, it's true. Whether they're help or not is separate issue. Does pylon have, like, snippets or whatever they. Some version of that? Like a pre canned. They do have like the, like the summaries and stuff, all the snippets. Like when you're good, respond to a customer. Can you just find like a pre written response? It can link to docs. We can set up docs on Pylon. Yeah, I'm working with that Elijah this week. You just need to update the Knowledge Base API to our gitbook. Yeah, we don't do it half we have not done. We have some life. We were a little worried. Like, yeah. I generated messages for period of time. But I absolutely should think to our dogs. Especially now that they're getting better, hopefully. Okay, but. So sorry. Link to the docs is like it. What's it do there? It. It just understands them. You can, like, search the knowledge base. Okay, cool. Cool. But you guys don't use. Like, if someone says, hey, how do I reset my password? You don't have, like, a. Just a canned response that's like, is that intent on purpose? Like, is you don't want. Okay? All right. That's another just, like, quick win type of thing. If there are questions that everyone asks, just, like, we could just write some responses that people could essentially just copy paste in piling. There is an FAQ in the git book for each section. Yeah. But it's. That's our understanding of what. User generated. I think it's based off of, to be fair. Like what users open up. But you are right. It's not like statistically. I'll say. The standardization one is one that Matt brought up to me. On week one or two. So I know it's. It seems like there's a lot of interest there between you guys and Matt there, too. Okay. Any other top? So we have just, like, generally, the documentation isn't updated or trustworthy. And then two is we have to standardize communication to customers. Any other major problems. Those are main things. Does the demand ones. I'm trying to figure out how Academy fall into this, but I think it's more so like prompting Academy links. Into Atlas. I don't think it's a game. I mean, we could also have academy links in each help guide. Yeah. I think that goal, having it in there. Feels like I'm really. Mad. Basic. Modules. This is how you sign up? You also want to see videos? Yeah, that's another. This week. There's weight. Yeah, it might be good to get the transcripts up Academy into the. Into Atlas as well. Okay? I feel like I have enough to start to think about this and maybe put some suggestions together on the Atlas side, but just. I know. I don't know. Andrew, Nikhil wanted any, like, conclusions coming out of this meeting just immediately. I don't even think. He just made that comment. That like what we're doing is a bridge. That at least start the conversation, which is true. I mean, it's not working. But also, I don't think we necessarily have final conclusions right now. Yeah. Okay. This is perfect. Yeah. I think this has in general, just, like, how do we teach people to use the platform? Yeah. Yes. This is like a piece. This is a part of that. So as part of making basis easy to use, When people do have questions about it. I read. Make sure it's very clean, succinct and consistent. Yes. How do we. The external docs are out of date. But other than that, do we think they are good? They are good. I like them on a seat like I just hard to navigate, but I think that information okay. They're not that hard to navigate by the way. Like, honestly, like, if you will, the navigation pain is pretty bad, but like, if you search anything, it will give you actual proper, like, which sections you want to. That part is pretty decent. Like, I use it for, like, truly, like, building any of the academy videos. Like, the way I learn this is either Keith or. Yeah, those are the main two sources. I don't know exactly. It's. The thing is, like. Users still don't use it at all. Feedback on Academy. Like, I could tell you how many users we have. It's not that many. Like, we're talking as if there's, like, that many people. I'm like, let me tell you how I do. I'm like, it's really not a lot. Now we have 85. But, like, active. Not that many. Understood, like, genuinely like. They probably have gone into Academy now more recently and click through. But will I say, like, they're actually active on it? Not that, no. And same with help guide. I don't think people have like if we email them now. Hey, look at the help guide. I'm sure we'll get click throughs. Let's see how like sustainable it is for them to keep going back to Academy. It makes sense. Makes sense. I'm building this, but I'm also, like, aware. Like, maybe that's just me. I prefer reading Overwatch. I think that's part of what we're trying to figure out. Is like what is the best medium and touch? Information. Yes. True, like at the end of the day. We could just say, like, the platform. Should be easier to use. No, it's true. Yeah, check actually. How many actually active ones. Now I'm curious. Let me. So, one thing I've been wanting to spin up, maybe starting next week or even this week, is essentially like a customer advisory board for Atlas. So, like, you guys are the customers of Atlas. As if. You know, Atlas was like a company. Curious, you know, to decide now, but, like yours, if any of you guys would be interested in being on that, if I do something like a weekly meeting, happy to. Okay, cool. Lines anyway with all the academy and get book stuff. Yeah, it could be a project plan for that anyway. Or project meeting for that anyway. Okay, I'll set it up. So we have 61 people on, like, academy, FYI. Most of them have not completed any kind of enrollment. There's 129. Courses complete. Like total courses. It's not bad. Yeah. Does that include business users, though? I removed all these nice. So not fun. Honestly, other than I expected. Wisp, by the way. A bunch of them signed up all at once. Great job. They didn't actually complete certifications or anything, but they signed up. Yeah. Most of them actually know how to use basis, though. No, that's the thing. That's the thing. But yeah, it doesn't. Yeah. But they were using it. They were like, okay. Well, let me ask one more question. Who is the person at the company that knows the external docs the best? And who is the person that knows the DI internal docs the best? Di I. I think might fall on your Elijah. Just because I had to do the last version of editing all of them. I did assign it to you guys, but it did have to read, unfortunately, all of it. But Elijah. So to be here, even when I knew something was wrong, I didn't know how to correct it, per se. So I would go to Elijah for that. And the internal docs on it. I would still say Elijah, honestly, like or Luke. It's between the two of them for the. You guys have been here the longest, so you would know the most. For the external docs. Yeah, the help guide. Okay. You were Elijah. I haven't touched them as much in the last couple months, so I'm, like, a little outdated. But no one has touched them in luxury. Issue that could be. Actually be very helpful with Atlas, which is, hey, this was like the latest PRs. In GitHub the last yes, next week. Do a comparison of, like, what that expected impact should be. And when you compare that to the content. Flag where you should get if we're not gonna have a formal, like, release process. Then that would be very cool. Yeah, that's one that Mitch is a big fan of and I think we should prioritize early. Is like that the latest PRs in GitHub? What was the expected impact? Like, flag those things eventually. Just, like, write the potential docs. Right. And then. But based on this conversation, I'm thinking we also need to communicate that with the DI Team. So it's like, all right, something has changed in the external docs. Like, everyone be aware of that. I feel like, in general, just communicating. Products and just. Like, there's a capability that, like, I remember. That opposite. Chris and I about, like, two weeks ago that, like, people like no one knew existed. Do we have, like, internally a way of or even anywhere that we're like, hey, we ship the new feature. Where's that? Gonna stop. No, no, they're not fully stocked. They still do them, but less frequently, twice a month. And you'll see it in the Help Guide. Like the shirt. Oh, I think they haven't done that in a little while. No, they did the list. No, they did, August, Because I followed us. I did. I think keith. Is supposed to update them, so I followed up. He's pushing it off. Jm to who? He's pushing. It off to Jeremy, is he? That's so funny. Okay. But I think we need proper external emos to clients. Like a mass proper one anytime any feature is released. And I think they tried to do that. I don't think that right. And what about just like for you guys, if you're like, hey, what have we shipped? What's changed in the product? Is there any sort of internal. Like if I had a bug and then they fix, for example, PDF pricing. I know that because they fixed my book. Because you're on the link, because you're on the line. Such that everyone kind of knew everything, just would talk about it. Yeah. But, yeah, totally sound. It's the case. Every single one's special. I don't know if it's a product that I haven't, like, had a customer say something to me. Such, and I was, like, tracking it with engineering. I love that. Exist. Like, now. The instructions are better where you can put simple instructions and it will, like, be somewhat better. Yeah, but I don't think anyone's ever had that. Okay, this is really helpful because there. It sounds like there are some things that we could do that aren't even, like AI and whatever, but just. Be like, we should just do it. Yeah. Yeah. Like. Like, I give an example. There's, like, a Slack channel, you know, once a week or whatever, you know. Yeah, like, I'm about. Like, as I said, I'm thinking about doing that with Atlas, which is just having, like, an FYI. Atlas. Anytime we ship anything, everyone can just stay up to date. Okay? Super helpful. Thank you Andrew for send this up. This is great for what I need as well, so. Yeah. Anything else? You guys. Anything else on. The, like, the medium we communicate and, like, how we're actually just, like, educating. Like, maybe even just, like, more core to, like, Di. One on one. Deployments. I mean the whole. Just so I understand. Correct? Ly. The whole point is that long term we're not going to be handled in clients to onboard, right? Like, what we want to do is kind of have them guide them to the guidebook atlas. To be available, whether we're handholding someone through that. There's a business decision. Okay. The goal should always be that we have enough content available. That's how much. Okay, be able to get started. Music. Yeah. As I wanted to answer your question, but just one side note. On Just Academy, have we thought about, like, getting, like, a freelance editor or whatever to work with you? Okay. I wish. Cause I just feel like, you know, it would just save a lot of time and they're not that expensive. No. I have no accounting background. I'm still doing it, so I'm sure someone else can learn that and do it themselves. Honestly, like it's a waste of time. In my opinion. But I know Nikhil's dad. Eventually we're gonna have someone to manage Academy fully, okay? Okay, But. Okay. I don't know when that eventually will be. Okay, I'll. I'll. Maybe I'll follow up with Nikki on that. I think that's a fair point. Like, well, we could go, like, super fancy, but I'm literally even just, like, someone that, like, zoomed in as you talked about something, like, you know, made a little click, you know, little. Stuff, but anyway. Back to you, basic. Yeah. Excited me speaking over walking you through, which people still like, apparently. But, you know, we can always go. More. But to your question of just, you know, are there just maybe some resume. What do you want to come back to? What you wanted to come back to? One final question. I forget. No, I think it's just about, like, how we approach. Users and new users. Yes, yes, yes. Understood. I think, still going back to, like, the medium of how we're communicating and more information we're providing. So this actually goes into a thing. I can send it to you guys. I kind of started to think about. Like as part of. Workspace. Release. And, like, some of the black and white communications, it kind of made me realize, like, Do we want to have? Or think about, like, user lifecycles. And the way that the analogy is like, I've worked in marketing in HubSpot, it's very Boolean. But you basically define users based on, like, certain definitions. And based on that definition of a user, they will enter it. So it can only comms paths. Of certain information content, they're targeted with certain. Depending on their reaction, they will like exit certain branches. Enter new ones. We even be more? It's basically, like the pilot program of, like, week one. You do this? Yeah. Yeah, I like that. For. For the. Not for the basically scale of users. I like that idea. Yeah. Is it linear enough, though, to say, like, you're. This type of. It could be based on, like, it could be. Also, I think we should be pushing people into other types that we have. For them. Like we should be trying to find, like, the Nyx of each firm. It's a good process. Generally. So potentially would make sense to have different. Types. Do you guys have, like, a quarterly sales cycle for upsells and things like that, or. Not really. Just sort of like, just getting them in and make sure they're happy, okay? Now that we're actually starting to expand beyond cast practices. Yeah. Upselling actually matters. Like now. We need to reengage and even practice. Like, get introduced to other practice leads and whatnot. Like starting to have it, but not before in last understud. But, yeah, I think that's a great idea, too. Makes a lot of sense. So the question for you, actually. Luke. After pilot when it becomes like the scale of aspect. Is mad involved in order to, like, get them to scale. Like, where. Where does sales come back in? So far, Matt is involved. And I don't think we've yet. I'm actually not sure. I'd have to ask George about this. I don't know if, like, George comes back into the picture to let, but I think because most of the firms that we're at that point with now. So right now that still matching upselling, which I think is not. Sustainable, but also for the time being, it's probably fun. For like, existing front cover off selling to but by like, end of the year, Like, for the firms that George has essentially brought in, like, making, like in a descent. I'm sure George will be more involved. Well, that's actually also a good question. When is official hand off? What is an official handoff? I don't think we know right now at all who's responsible for upsells. Yeah, yeah. We have no all open questions, okay? Yeah, Very good. All like important GDM deploy process things that we. I think we're discussing. Capacity. Like I know. George is going to stay involved. In some sad things, I think, throughout the pilot, because it's like, structure is very unclear. Yeah. He's like. Only he's have some weekly meeting with someone. As they go through the pilot with the first brack, but also the PE roll up aspect makes it much more complicated. Selling to different. Firms within the same. Rack. It doesn't seem to standardize at all. Across any of them, honestly. Kind of fun. And kind of get away with this for now? Right now? Yeah. Yeah. But it's soon now. But once you're at 40, top account, like, I don't think this is possible. Makes sense. But to Andrew point of like the life cycle, we don't have to worry necessarily about an upsell life cycle just like life cycle, do they, users? No, but that's great. I really like that. I think even at that point, like, if we have specific users, we can even target them within academies differently. To increase usage. Yeah, okay. This is great. And yeah, I could definitely see how this is gonna tie back into analytics because we're wanna know each of those users. Are they active or not? Or, like, you know, high volume user or whatever you wanna call it? Yeah, I think there's certain things, like within the app that can be. Triggered of you signed in. This firm is now in scale up technically. Yes. You are now a user bed Simony. Based on your actions. And you can basically send all connected Yale. Did you connect to Bank? You had to client set up. Did you do anything? For the first time. Did you close it? Up, then you have calls to action for the next thing. With, like, the associated. Yes. There's ways to make that super linear where there doesn't need to be any, like, intelligence or engineering involvement. And then there's, like, an optimal point where you have a much more complicated version of a defined user. And their interactions with. Yeah. What do we used to send? Do we have any sort of email system right now? I heard we use knock and or. Okay. But then keeping loops. From loops every day, so there must be something. We edited the Knox video. Knocks. I mean, even. Numbers. Cool. We used Luke's in my last company. But not knock. But I'm familiar. Okay, cool. If I low end background. Was able to edit. You're gonna master. Cool. All right. This is really good. Okay, so I'm right this up and try to. I'll send around something after with just, like, some conclusions. And let me feel free to, you know, edit or say what you guys think is best. I think on the very core, Atlas is just like getting the docs into a good spot. And so I think that I might need to team up with you and Elijah at some point to just, like, break up the work and go from there. So that's probably the first. Part. Okay, cool. I think there's an important distinction between, like, what it can do and how we say it works, and I think there's always gonna be a difference. Yes. Nuance is important when firm is. Yes. Perspective. Yeah. 100%. Awesome. And then. Yeah, and then I'm just looking at. There's probably some small quick wins with just, like, slack and pylon that we can do that will help tide us over until Atlas is doing some stuff. Automatically. Sweet. Awesome.
