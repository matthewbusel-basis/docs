Me: Commercial. So that's another issue. That was brought up. Did she mention what banks do you she wanted to connect to. It's all those keys. Don't banks anyways. Obviously, the ball begins. The better. Because popin. And bivalance. They have to do a whole bunch of manual uploads. And it already integrates with zero, so. Or a qbo, depending on which ones, but. Yeah. So it's a disadvantage. That visa sense. I think. Two things, I think. One is that when you roll out, that's released in one of the features. But when we roll out the new bank statement, Thing from feasibility last week. That should be rolled in pretty soon. This week. Metal a lot because it'll make the manual uploads way easier. Because you won't have to map it. You'll just dump your statements in it. Something's not going easier. The feed literally is not something that this gets out of our control. Where we already integrate with the three most prominent. Connectors. Where we integrate. Finish that you applied and go, please. So if we don't have it on them, the reason qbo, by the way, for those who don't know reason QBO might have it and we don't because QBO is the OG in building their own bank connection. Thing. So they were actually three day plaid. And everything. It just kind of random. Like there are things plaid has that they don't have and vice versa. But obviously, because they've been doing it for 30 years. So this one is a little out of perpetual. The place where it gets. I'd say there's two types. Of situations here. One is where the bank just doesn't exist on our side. Which maybe is the case here, actually. Yeah, some of those farming small. They're just panel banks. They're just weird banks. Super community banks, we can't really do much about those. But if we have a new experience that makes it easier, that is a big improvement network. We should, by the way, I'm actually kind of surprised. We should maybe get a couple of the names because I actually suspect that some of them we do support is just under different means because the way it works, I can look into it. Because like qbo, they can obviously just ensure that because they know they kind of make their customers. Because it's all business. Where with blood and Felicity and you, theirs is across. It's not just business accounts. So there's not tailored to the customer. That we keep business. But the thing is that because they do it via scraping, a lot of the times when they use like a lot of times the small community banks, they don't build out their own web platform. They instead, they use a provider. And so sometimes the connections are under a different name. But they work for the bank. Okay? Let's try to cap this one. Maybe towards 30 seconds longer. Just so we can make sure we get. Yeah, I think we're good. Yeah. Yeah, we're done. Yeah, I was like, if you guys should be interested to just see. Just get a couple of interviews. Specifically the ones that connect. In qbl, we don't connect. That would be interesting to see. Next one. So what this is basically is Apryl said we get new clients all the time. And we want to be able to have a way where we can. It would be great if Basis could scan through our GL or our clients BL and be able to come up with a request. List for their new clients. So I think that this would actually be a great use case for a procedure and workspace. Because Abery said that they don't necessarily want to add their new clients on the Basis. Because there's usually some cleanup. But you can upload like a year worth of transaction history or trial balance. And have Basis review that. And based on the accounts. Suggest. Oh, you'll need to suggest or request your bank statements. In there. Account logins and, oh, they have a loan. You'll want to request their loan. Their loan contract, things like that. That's basically what it says. Yeah. I think it's a great. You could do that now. And I think that. The only work here is understanding. If you're going to make the procedure. Sit down with it and just understand it. Reach the extent of the use case better. It's like, okay. Imagine that you had a person at after you're doing this. Imagine you were writing instructions for them. What is that? And just have them talk it out to you. And have that control up. It's like, okay. Someone. Do you have the bank statements? What are the possible options? What is the particular needed? Sensing how the workflow works. And I bet you. Honestly, this seems pretty common as a workflow. So I imagine, like, GPT5 probably understands this pretty well, too. Yeah, I think this is very dope. It's just like, what are the documents going in? And then what are the things they want out? It's not the doctor, Tony. Or just, like, a bunch of bank statements? And include the most recent tvs. Is it like? What's the info it includes? And then we can make a procedure to do that. This procedure is much easier. Than the. Warhammer1. The harder version of this. Is the cleanup. Like the cleanup also, I think can be done into procedure in the future. This is much easier. Than. I think we could do this. To be honest, I wouldn't like, over promise them. But. Okay? So just add to roadmap note in one page. But we can have secure. Yeah, it's not really a roadmap thing. It's more of a. I think the thing here that's hard is. If we got all the information from Opio, then it's like a weird. So, to me, the thing here is about getting information. You can make a linear ticket for me. If you want. Okay? One Just small comment. I was like, on some of these, it'd be really nice. Having the Ryan boat is good here, but it really is at the top of. It's just like, what is this feature request? Oh, they want. A win for Basis to spit out the requirements. Because otherwise I had to read the whole paragraph, just understand what it is. Does it make it? Just not. That similar to the wise matters, but just I would go to the Widen spiders. I don't know what it is. All right, summit. I'll get the shorts. Just to stay once. I can. Maybe. When? Your ticket for this one. I'll podratch. Just be like delivery. Yeah. I mean, this is on our road. Number. One. Next one, Summit. So she's Sarah for that one. Actually, one thing that would be good. For maybe everyone. At some point. Is to just add, we'll do more of this later. Which are the schedules that are most used. I think I know. But it'd be interesting to see which one seems. Is it all just brutate and fixed asset schedules? Or are there? What are the 8004? Next1Support AI Q&A. So basically, they just want to be able somebody wants to be able to have a chatgpt, like feel like being able to ask questions about the financial. What happened? This is kind of. Yeah. We have a procedure. No, but it's too slow. Because jobs are just stuff. This is like when we release Fast Mode or whatever, end of market, we'll chat. This one is. I just suspected. The new flux. No, we have a cult with them tomorrow. To sheds and design s. Okay? Great. I think that will satisfy a lot of this. And then the reason it'll satisfy a lot is because you'll be able to get the information at. Lots of different. Cuts of potato. Yeah, it's 10 on that call. Yes, or he's on. No, he's on that one. He's under one. I think just a context summit is like unique situation with a lot of our sky, which is they have. A pretty clear onshore offshore structure. Where they have seniors onshore. And an outsourced all of the work. And they very much want to go into the FBA direction. Place at a virtual schedule trying to go in the direction they're very much efficiency minded. They're more aggressive than some of the other. Clients who come across. Which is why all the officers are betting my children. Off. Should I just keep this as new for now? Or would you like me to? No, let's keep this as new. Yeah, I think there's, like, a couple. I think this is one of the things where it's like, either we will have Chad work there. We need to figure out how do you go from flux into your workspace? And sort of chat with that. Well. And then we'll need that speech. To be good. So I think there's some things. In workspace. I'm like, okay. How do we get it to be really fast in the chat link experience? Next one. Ability to edit. So this one. The roadmap from a transaction standpoint. But it's not possible. For the reconciliation standpoint. So basically, what wants to be able to do is they want to be able to edit transactions directly. From Basis to qbo. They don't have a book reco. Il classification. Change the amount directly from Basis. So this is on the roadmap for transactions modules. They also want to be able to do this from limited rec. So when on a rut, you'll see the reconciling items. And if they see reconciling item that they're like, oh, that should be deleted. Their hope was that that line in the GL correlates to an endstream qbo, and their hope was that they could edit. Have some sort of way to edit that. Directly. In Basis. Well, you're saying in line and rec ins inside Basis or in line and right instead of QBL inside of ACEs. I don't really understand because the reconciling item is not. I need to actually go. But if this is not at all related to editing reconciliations in gbo, then yeah. It's okay. I thought it was related to editing. Reconciliation. Even qdl transaction details. It could be up. Like the journal entries we post. Oh, no. Editing them, posting. That's all you think? Yeah. And Bradley they will help because right now, if they make a mistake, In Basis they have to go fix and qbosi. So if we're able to do more than just post brand new anyways. Bradley they will help with a lot of other operations. Not just this. Yeah. Well, this is an interesting thing, for as you look at transactions, Too. Is you want to be able to. We kind of need to figure out in the system. Where it makes sense for you to be making edits. To your own trees. If you want. So in the line of rec, that makes a lot of sense. That's, like, one place. And the other place. Actions. So yeah. I think Bradley Conceptually, like making updates. Into. Into the system. I actually updated the. Transaction. I think part of this might also be like thinking through security model. Where some clients might want the ability to post correcting entries are the ones that want to do these updates, but you probably need some kind of security models. So that we're not allowed users to post those. I like that idea, actually. Really applies to larger, definitely enterprise. But I would say. It's not really best practice to directly edit your entry. You should be looking. Absolutely. The regular data is more like QuickBooks and Zero. They do it once it gets sage and above Enterprise. You cannot edit test. You have to make an adjusting entry. Always correctly, but that's actually kind of my initial thing. I'm not telling. My initial instinct is that we should default to the way the ledger does. Like, for example, why are we putting additional in qbo, you can edit a journal. So why are we now saying you can't in zero. You can't handle the journal. When you edit a journal, you book a reversal. Editor. Think that's how it works. So our policy should be the Ledger's policy. We shouldn't be creating new policy on top of the budget. That's on the ledger. I don't disagree. It would be confusing. We do that. But I think there's maybe other question which is, like, from a permissioning perspective, who should be able to do right? That's like a larger permissioning question. But I think on the reading, reading and writing, we should stop. Goals go to sample. When we do that. This will be like our project. Thank you for. This is blocked by moving off merge. Once we move off of merge. Now that you do that. Sarah Project. Obviously, this issue keeps. Next one. Forecasting. Plant analysis is the Basis. This is going to be achieved through a procedure in workspace. And also be able to chat when they chat. So after, we're going to create a vertigraph instructions. That I've seen a test out. But be able to run a procedure where you have inputs, which is the summit's standardized forecast plan analysis. And then. Their account financial statement mapping. Considering those two documents Basis will identify the top variances. And then surface data for further investigation. And then after the procedure is run, Then some Gilman can ask follow up questions. It is a little slow. To your point, so it's not ideal. Question is, it's just a budget to actual comparison. Yeah. It's like its budget and forecast. Okay. Worked on that. So maybe you want to send them over. Anything that you built. It. So you're not just that. Collateral. Yeah. We have example. I'm making one now. Oh, I have. Heck. Yeah. I've been spending the last hour building this. Okay? I don't know if you're making, like, linear tickets for this. Yeah, if you want, you can. Okay? Next one. Is selfishly me. Just ability to be able to track metrics by permission group. And pilots. Yeah. This makes sense. So this is kind of funny. I think it'd be more and more towards over time. Especially as being kind of like, We should do this. We don't have the best to do this right now. This is not going to probably. Like if you want to accomplish Devin, both reach. A lot of revenue before they roll the mouth. And I know because I'm a customer and I want and I think her only rolled out the metric stuff. We'll do this. But probably not this year. Do we have permission? Group ids? Somewhere. In table plus. To where we can just aggregate at least all of the metrics that we can sum not really get averages. I'm wondering if there's, like, manual Garcia that we can write. In, tanya. That 's definitely. Something. We do. I think there's a baby step here. The current metrics that we have scheduled, reports that all depends on this, send out customers, and there are some basic reporting that we are not doing. No, that's a very good topic, and that's easy. Within here. Just to see what we're. Yeah, I think that's right. Exactly. You can make a career. I think it's very marked, yeah. The only thing the note right is there are in the database. You have information that it's about? Things done. Like tasks and this thing dumb this thing done but shown how logged in you don't have that kind of stuff. But I think for the purposes of what people want, Maybe that's fine. So, yeah, I kind of think if we define. Hey, here's the exact metrics we want. When making that SQL query. Is relative. Like you can take a stab at any of them. After that comes to meet your Joe and we can help you. So, just for clarity, Lyra is working on this currently. Which is pulling together all the different kinds of metrics. We have across onboarding users. Getting developed to speed usage. With the category. Doing that you can work with your how we actually execute. I think we should go soon. Last time meeting today, actually. Next one. So for Aprio, they want to have like after an account is reconciled, they would like a reconciliation report auto generated. And added to their file storage. At the end of the month. This is to that like for Aprio, it's important that they show evidence that we reconciliation. They're both for audit purposes. Both for clients to show. Up. And if they're no longer doing organizational agencies in qbo, they need some sort of way. To show their client. This is on like all the Rex in the rec module. Yeah. Currently, this is what it looks like. In studio. This is just the bank, right? Yeah. This is just the bank. But they can see there's some sort. There's a reconciliation report that looks official. That they can share. With their clients as well as. Use for audits. Yeah. So it's a couple questions. So one question is. Are they doing cash? Are they moving cash reacts from. I forget. I don't really remember what though TBO unlikely but for zero. So if they're not moving the cash fries. They don't need. To catch. It. They'll need it for General. Like, really. Any. It's most important for cash tracks, because that's the most important. But they'll need this. That would be an impression. The other rep not being cursing out this. Right? Oh, yes. This would be regression. Like the cash, Rex would be a regression. But the other side. Is like it's only mention. Ed. So I believe right now. I believe there is. Like an Excel. Yeah. There's an Excel export. It's an Excel. All of your ranks. Yeah. Excel, not PDF. And then for line number X, once the original MVP is done, there will be an Excel export. That looks like that. To show the ball forward. And excel at. Yes. Yeah, we can make it as. Think there are baby steps there. 's like Black Line has this functionality as well. You can just, like, print a reconciliation. Attended like a PDF and then all the attachments. Are like roll into the PDF. Yeah. No. It's a good idea. We should. We should. We should always. Okay? I think. We should do this. I don't think. Let's figure out. When to get it in, but I think as we get. So I think this probably is more convenient. This seems lower privacy. And then the other one I was going to mention was you don't meet up right there. The chop one. Yeah, I was going to say this is, like, literally going to happen. Oh, nice. So this is like the bank statement. Thing. Working. So the way. For just awareness of the way it's going to work. Is that. And we should definitely go to the folks who had a lot of trouble with this, like Kyle from Hancock. And drought and of other folks. Where the Excel uploads will stay the same. But the banks, the PDF, upload it. So right now, for those who haven't used it before, the way it's horrible. And I'm actually, like, amazed. That anyone's even tried even uses it. At all. So the way it works right now is you dump the PDF in. It parses it, and then it puts it into this table. That looks like. It's called one schema. It looks like an Excel, and then you can validate, and then you click import, and then that's what kicks off the Arnold job. To go and do the transactions. The problem with that is that reading the PM actually is, like, takes a little bit of time, so you have to sit there for, like, a minute. Sometimes more like I read is like 2 minutes, 3 minutes. Then you have to sit there and wait. It tells you not to leave. You can't close the tab. It tells you not to, but it's not obvious, and there's a lot of people will do that. And then, like, leave because they think it's happening. And then it never worked. It never goes through. And then on top of all of that, On top of how annoying that is, you have to only do one at a time. It's still per account, but let's say you're trying to look like six months. Of one account. You have to do six PDF. So six sequentially of you can technically do many times at once, but no one knows that. So I upload the PDF, I wait two minutes. Now, what you'll be able to do is be much simpler where it'll look more like workspace. Where you can just drag in a bunch of files at once, a whole holder or multiple files at the same time. And then it'll just go. Done. There's no need to do anything. So you don't need to validate anything. You don't do anything. It will just go. And figure it out. And then run the jobs. And the reason it'll be able to do that now is it'll be much more accurate. Still using one schema. No one. That's what I'm saying. You don't need to sit there and wait for it. You just throw it in and then go home. Okay, we're using, like, a different PF parser. Than. Okay, well, one schemach was never the PDF course. One schema was the thing that you would like validated. I see. It will go. It will parse it. It'll be much, much more accurate. It'll also be doing lots of the checks that you would normally do. So, for example, it's going to be adding up all the statement lines, seeing that equals the balance, doing a lot of verification like that. And then it's going to just automatically go and kick off Arnold, and then you'll get a notification just like you would today once Arnold's done. So you'll get a notification that it's done, but you're being done means that the transactions are in the transactions app, ready to go. Nice predictions are made. Et cetera. That's awesome. If there is, like, a validation stuff that fails, do they get an email? That would indicate that. Yeah, good question. If it fails, they'll get an email. Okay. And the email will just be like, You need to talk to us? Pretty much. The way to think about this is that right now, There is no validation. That the user would do and once he manually that the agent is not doing itself. So all the validation agents also doing it. Right. The only thing that could happen. Is that it could miss a character. In the description. And so you can have a description. And it's, like, always a zero. So it's possible your description is, like, slightly off, but it's not a big deal. The thing that matters is the date and the amounts, let's say in the description, Bradley correct. And so that'll just go. So it's not. So if we get the description wrong. By one letter. First of all, it's not like a. No, the user wouldn't got that. The user would never. Exactly. The user would never have caught that interior. Would that be like a lower confidence interval in theory? Because it's not, no. But this is an interaction to be too like. One of the features will be description cleanup. Like everybody wants that. You have the agent decide what the descriptions like. Better descriptions instead of the OG descriptions. And that way, like, the original description doesn't even matter anymore, and you just have it for, like, audit purposes, inside Basis anyway. It's cool. Awesome. One piece of context here is that Trout may be a candidate for full moon deployment. In Q4. New guy there. We'll tell Luke. Tell them that this is coming. I will. I will. It's a great center. It's gonna be so good. I'm very nice. I tried using it. Last week. It's actually absurd. And for those who went through the book and you know how excited. This is. Yeah, this morning, we're uploading stuff, and then each one, they're like, oh, this is ridiculous. And that's even good, so this is going to be much better. All right. Well, that takes us to. Well, Sarah Whether it's just a flag for foot, the one thing doesn't include which we'll do is on test follow because it doesn't do brokerages. So banks and credit cards. Okay. I don't know what Travis. Brokerages. No. They're using big statements and credit cards. Number. Cool. And the same process will probably relate to write ups v2. Right. Yes. We know your numbers. 2. Is. Yeah. It has that same sort of like one scheme of validation step. Which is. Oh, you're saying uploading. You're seeing uploading library. But the Excels are the same. So the way to think about this is you're just letting the agent do it all. If you wanted perfect control over the data, You upload yourself. Because uploading the cell, the parsing is more deterministic, and so you can validate that. You can get what you want. So in this case, your agent's doing it for you. If you aren't perfect. You want to use the Excel. Cool. So with the Excel, you still upload and you wait for the one scheme. It's very fast, though. Within yourself. So as you wait for the launch team and then you look through and you say, like, good to go with the PDFs, you just don't. All right, so. Just any action items or notes that we talked about. Just make sure, like, the pylon ticket is updated. Before end of week. And then YouTube.
