## Transcript
 
Me: I mean, I think a lot of people are trying to measure. Same types of metrics, but for different reasons. Give me this. No. Okay? Metrics gathering. We were just thinking about overall. What are the different internal and external use cases of our metrics? Side note, they're thinking right now, they're literally having a discussion on metrics over there for workspace. Over. Personas, all of this. How do we. I think. Here's one of my opinions on workspace. I like workspace. Done on the record. It is a bit daunting on how to use at the beginning when I see this. In my bits. I mean, extremely. So it's like how we make this more palatable, and that's what they're doing. I'm not working on that at all. I'm guessing that's what they're doing. On the other hand. Here, I'll start this on this page. And then. Over here. So what I was thinking of was like, hey, just in general, start with cas and we can break it out a bit more into some of the castes and what basis look like before workspace. Do you know the main. Do you know cast? What it stands for? Client Advisory Services. I've read the onboarding doc. Essentially, yeah, it's like outsourced surfacing. So it's like there's audit and tax, which may not work on the same month to month workflows, but just think of, like, Cass as, like, the people who do the monthly close. Right. And that's what basis has been so far in terms of its main users. Yeah. Use case. So, yeah, Cats practices. Like, we're meeting with a lot of cast partners, senior accountants, and then they outsource maybe a lot of the prep work s either way. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this and, like, what's most effective. But kind of boiled metrics down into onboarding metrics. So these are like pay number of clients, onboarded client creation of folder created, client creation of moolah connection. So some of these types of metrics that. And just to back up for one sec, these are like the goal of these metrics in your head, is it to get a picture of the health of a firm or like, what's the two goals? One. Okay, one second. Okay, so for onboarding and performance, Two goals, one internally. Just want to make sure that. We can identify where bottlenecks are before we, you know, before the client realizes. Like, I'm sure a lot of these metrics. If there is poor performance, which is great to average. Probably implicit, and then making decisions on whether they expand, they stay put, or if they even churn right. Number two is actually presenting it to the clients is like use cases. One of the charts that showed yesterday was, hey, what does this show? This is aprio for usage over the past week by user number of minutes spent in the platform. Right now, when I look at metrics, This is probably, I think, one of the ones where I show them. This is what we show. I think it's not very compelling. I created this slide so I could say, this is not my slide. Right. It's not the most compelling. I think it's just a bunch of static numbers that don't really give us the journey. The question is, we even have enough usage for us to warrant this, but it's like, hey, for pilots, like, short term. Seems like. You know, showing something that's a bit more visual. May help. That comes from post hocs. This is gonna come from, I think, cursor as well. Can help us pull this cursor. Do visuals like Python does. I mean you can ask it to do anything. Like Judge of D, you can ask doing things. Yeah, but chatgpt can't pull you charts then. Yeah, I would. I wouldn't expect Christian to build that. Got it. Maybe again, like it could write a script or something and export it after. Yeah, it makes it. Easiest way to do it. Though. Yeah. So that's. That's what I have so far, where it's like, hey, like, maybe we just need to start building these metrics. And yeah, I'm put. Ting my. But so are you more focused just from your perspective? You're like, we need metrics to be able to see if onboarding is going well and show to the client to encourage better onboarding. If that's sort of your main area. Yeah, it's more like, yes. It's that and then showing the overall health of the company. Is it staying home in the future? And today, aside from, like, what you pulled. Today. You said you're going to postdoc to sort of, like, do this ad hoc or is there a dashboard? We haven't postdoc that. I'll show you. What we're doing today, we're doing two things. One is going into me and Elijah. When? In last week. Elijah spent more time than I have. But, like, I can pull my own SQL queries. So if I go into here, I can pull my own count based on certain metrics and pull my own either queries I can write. So I think it's called post ql. Pretty big. So maybe I can do it from here if I start from scratch to SQL editor that they have. And I can make charts based off of that or their embedded charts that they have. So that's one. Then 2. Justin, who was an intern. Created some of these where it's like, all you have to do is, let's say here, I post my firm and it gives me the metrics for that firm. On the other hand, Sara said she doesn't trust some of these numbers and actually probably agree with her, so it's not ideal right now. Like this will just pull me. Hey. For the entire firm. Average days prediction Average day's proposed action checklist signed off. They're pretty rudimentary in the metrics. That would probably just pull from. I mean, you saw Tanya usage metrics. So he probably just said, You know? Just going to the back end. Say this one was user traffic and time to action. So here's the chart. User traffic. So here's the code for it. I'm guessing there's just, like, a variable based off of the month and the firm. For f name, not like basis. Great. Group by book id. It's probably a where statement somewhere in here for the other variable. But that's what pulls these metrics that. Don't want to do that. So this is what we have so far. It's a combination. But I don't think. We've, like, honestly done it in a way that's, like, usable for the full DI team. Yeah. Understood. Okay. And so not to interrupt, like if I wasn't here. What's your plan for right now? What are we planning to spend the hour on in that van, honestly? I was probably just gonna go through. The deck. That created. Combination of playing around in Tanya going into table plus seeing if these actually are believable. And then creating different dashboards. And tables based off of this, but combining it with visuals. In retool and retool? I don't know. I just don't think retools like this is what I probably get stuck on. I don't think it's best analytics platform. Yeah. So I'm like, is there a better way for us to show it? Do we have any other, like, tools that are more visual leaning? Instead of retool in this case. Yeah, that's when I consider a database. Right. Exactly. Totally agree with you. So it's funny, like, I feel like you guys are super or have been, like, very forward thinking on all the tool choices, like, all the modern tools. The one that I'm like, was expecting was, I don't know if you know, metabase. Like a popular one these days. Nothing crazy, but it's like a visualization for creating stuff like this on top of databases. I've never personally used it. But it's just like in the Zeitgeist, the way all these other tools that ACG says. But anyway, I agree with your assessment. Though you could probably do this in retold. It's probably not the ideal situation. Yeah, I mean, I think if we make a business case, I don't think Matt has been cheap when it comes to tools, you know, which I appreciate. Yes. Because I've seen cases where companies have been cheap. But if there's a business case like, why don't we just have you use it before? Never use it before. There might be better ones. I'm just familiar with it being one of the popular ones these days. Might be better ones. Yeah. I mean, we'lling to try it. I think at the end of the day, we still need to write the queries, so that's probably gonna be the first step of it. How about postnatal? Is that not just, like, better than retool? Post hog we can only use for implicit data, say. Hey. Usage page views. That kind of stuff because post hog doesn't actually one, it's only at the accountant level. So it doesn't actually when we're recording a video. It's never gonna tell you which book it's looking at, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's only gonna tell you, hey, whoever this recent person is. But it's not. Postdoc isn't hooked up to the database. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Got it. So I guess that'd be the other route is we could postdoc does, I think, connect to databases? So you cook. Potentially do that too. But anyway, not trying to distract. But just curious what you were thinking. Okay, cool. Well, I'll just watch then. And maybe ask a question, too. But I don't wanna. I think this is what I gotta figure out. It's like, hey, I'm probably gonna be a mix right now. Just. Great. I'll have this. On my personal. And would love to, you know, here if you have any questions as we go through it. But. Oh, shit. Don't want quit. I don't want to do it right now. Okay, so here we go. So first thing is, and I start a new. Great. Here are all these tables. Have you used table bus much since starting? No, I'm familiar with it, but I haven't really clicked around much. Got it. All right. I want to create my own. Cool. I mean, some of these will be pretty easy. I do want to see how. It's usable here. So firm past progress. I also don't know all of the different variables here. So that's something I also have to learn about. Just like how the tables, all the wheels and the tables. Yeah. Exhausted to their tables. But these are, like, one of these projects. Where I can't just do it in, like, a week. Yeah, you have to understand the database. Super well. Yeah. That's what makes it harder. One month. Start. Great for hands. I don't even know what this is testing for. What that monthly progress number is. Is it like people that have used the product? Or no idea. No. No idea. So, I mean, this is commented, which is helpful. Firm level completion mirrors the date and book logic of the user tracking crate. So. I mean, if I just even plug this in, you'll be able to see that. Just like what that's even giving out? This is all the Bucs. So that makes sense. So first it's grabbing all the box. Great. From v bucks. Done describing relevant checklist tasks. I think it might be Buck's ass. Me learning. I don't have any. That's why. Yeah. Great. Books as. A parameter here. This is what I wanted to avoid. Just with that. Copy paste and all done. I don't want to. Just because of all the parameters. All right. The sun. Nothing came out. I do this? Just try to do it without parameters. Whenever this will work. I also don't have much postcard SQL experience, so my syntax is just brutal. Yeah. Okay, so at least it's not returning an error. There we go. I wish I could just. I could just start this from scratch, to be honest. Okay? But I do want to learn a little bit more about how all the current utils are working. So onboarding stage finished. We don't want test we don't want for some reason. Sure he's done some iteration. Due date. Date is a period month. So pta. Tasks. Accountants. So these are ones that are signed off. I'm guessing. That's fine. Technically, I could just do this. Let's see. Great. Est the last three months. I wonder why. Parent task type. Isn't showing up. This is not helpful. Yeah. Apparent task type. Showing up is. Oh, I said parent task. I don't know. Go back in here. I think. I think one of the issues is that this was written without injustice. Grade fantastic. Sure. But I think this was written about like much review. On what it means. We've been using it as one source of truth, but like any, give you a perfect example. One conversation, and I probably messed up and I needed to check. My privilege. To some extent, like one shad I had. Giordano who's like, we got this request. And then I was, like, happy to help. Blah, blah, blah. Should be good to go. So I don't think we can do this. This was basically what I said. And he's like, but in Bill it says we can. The reason why I was like, hey, I don't think we can do this. Was. From chatgpt. And like Claude both saying. Like we most definitely cannot do this. I was like, are we sure? You guys double check. Here's the breakdown. We can't do this. And like I asked like four different ways and then found out that we can in the system wrong. So this is gonna take me a bit longer. Do you have any questions on this or any thoughts? More just, like, trying to take it all in, I think. That's. Should I just start just writing the first couple. Just do it manually. Yeah. Ready for this. Let's see. Go to the deck. This one should be the easiest. Working on that. This whole world of. I mean, I think in the previous world. I used to, like, set aside, like, six hours straight just to work on, like, a SQL query. Yeah. And in this world, everything's so short form that I'm like, you're expected to have the answer within 10 minutes. And I think there's people who are really good at it. I just haven't learned how to do it well. I think to me it's like you have to. We have so many tables and fields that like, it's very hard to do this unless you really understand all those neighbor's feelings. Yeah. It's a good point. That's not what I wanted. Okay? The reason is I want to start getting this where it's, like, actually easier visually. And I guess, technically, you could put. This on what I wanted. Great. How come there are multiples of the same firm? Here. This one. There's multiple aprios. It's group by month, right? It's not just. So it's each month. Yeah. Got it. But has there only been one new client so far? And this is not right. Oh, no, it is right because it's in finish state. We have to make sure we're defining what the month start is. That a select firm client book min book created ad. Timestamp for the first finished book. All right, here we go. This is great. Yeah. Thank God I don't have to work on all these case ones. Nice. That looks good. Next thing is. I messaged my trusty friend Sara. And so, like, what will she just has in her head of just kind of roughly how many? Or is she gonna check something else? Yeah, just look at this. It's like February two. The reason why I picked Aprio, because it's so distinct. There's no new clients. July onwards. June was the first one. Or June was a dental practice likely, and then March. Was something else. But I think what I probably need to do. How different do you expect that today in terms of the numbers relatively. I think timing will be the same, but I think the reason why is I actually don't know if we charge by client or by book. So this time they just connected it to the V books instead of the clients. Neville told me there was no views. I'm pretty sure v clients and the books are both views. Oh, this was books. But they pulled client I.D. so in this case, they're just pulling book I.D. got it. Okay? See how these numbers are a bit higher. 27 21. Okay, great. I feel relatively good about this. As a start. Nice. I can at least get, like, one of these setup. Content creation to Mola Connection. If I can get this and I can get a bunch of different dates, and I think it's gonna be relatively similar because if I go to. I wish I could. Type other. Side, bro. Yeah. Until you date. On this. See if this will break my computer. I'll be real. Yeah. It's not gonna run well. See it, joe. Not great. So many issues. On Apprio. Just one user that's just very trigger happy. But she does make a good point. As far as. On call. On. This can't take long. I'm only gonna get 10,000. This is part of my issue. Maybe there's a table. So here's that first folder. Time book. Minimum created first Mola. It's not what I want, but let's just look at this. See how this is wrong. But this is interesting. So first mole I created at first folder connected. Select firm client name client created at date first folder create that date. First mole of creating that page. V bucks. Left Join first folder. Deleted. No. Where is the date first folder created at Minus applying Theta that same time we didn't even need for a smaller created app. I want it so only has non deleted books. That's fine. One other thing I want to do. Right. We have all these stupid workspace ones. Poly just like a dumb. Weird. I thought you conclude the variable name and aware. I don't think this is right. So for me to check this. I don't even think this folder is created for Croft Group yet. It's one of my clients. So I'm going to do is go into appasis. You know, it's like an absolute monster at this. Neville Monday night, help me figure out things. And he's just like. You're playing Fortnite? No, but I've seen people play Fortnite. People are, like, crazy with, like, creating bricks on top. He looks like that just going through, I mean, well, so he has the best understanding of the database because. He built most of it, as my guess. Yeah, he built it, but it's still crazy to see. It literally felt like he was just building. So, like, no folder was ever selected, so this is just wrong. Because there's an error. When this happened last time. Back to this probably could create a right now I don't want to. Oh. So one thing is this. Time's out pretty quickly. As well. This time's out pretty quickly. If I can get this. And just, like, actually have it reliable. Then this is gonna unlock me for the rest of these. Because these are all like time difference between client creation and a different mola. Very different. You know, more. Can mean two things. This is why this is probably, like, not best. So the first mullet created that? That's correct. Then all of these cases they created, they connected their ledger on the same day they created there. So probably what I would do in this case is, First folder created at first bowl I created that should. I want to see if there's any cases where, like, they're not equal so far. Look at this. Here we go. 8 19, 828 20. De dago. And so what's the indicate deal? If it's a different date, this indicates that, like, hey, they created the client, but they weren't actually able to connect their ledger until two weeks later. Like, why is that happening? It's not the best look. Yeah, something went wrong. With this changes. All right, let's try this. Wrong. Hey, walter. Over here behind the big platform. Do you have a sec? I'm just thinking about, like, what you guys were talking about. And I think. I don't know if there's a lot of, like, synergies here. And like what you're like, I'm gonna get this. But we're basically looking at all the metrics. Internally. I talked to Austin about this two weeks ago when he was doing the telemetry stuff. It's just not relevant at all. But, like, we're pulling basically overall firm health. Metrics. You guys are solely focused on workspace. But yeah. Only works, okay? Why is that? Is it just. It's sort of works. As much. So it's something to go on. Got it. But there's no reason. Like, if we think a synergist, there's no reason. Well, I think the only thing that would be helpful for me is that if you guys already have some pre written code. Like pulling certain things. I don't know if you're pulling it off in Table Quest, like, it might be helpful to look at. Just so, like, I can see if there's anything that's scalable at high end. Let me. I'll put you. There's a group chat. This is all we're. Kanye's read a script. That's an important all the running information. Andrew is gonna, like, aggregate the numbers. So that we have some report. Ing. Right. And then I just want to start mocking stuff. Into. Okay, so Andrew's do it in retool. They're gonna do it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So that's not a computer. Actually, I'm not as mutual. For now, what we're saying here is use retool, and then they cook it up to whatever. Dashboard. But I don't know if there's a better task. Pricing. This is exactly what we were talking about. What do you guys. Actually, have you seen Retold? Usually for, like, admin stuff. I actually haven't worked. I haven't created or. Actually, this is what it looks like. This is the back end. Here's the front end. In terms of how it's created in this way, it's, like, pretty clunky. I think you can make a chart. So you have to make it separately, like, this is a table view. You have to go in and explicitly be like, I want to create a shard field. What do you guys actually. I don't like your analytics. I like it for a lot of other, like, DI enablement stuff. Like tooling. Like tooling. Myself. Yeah. Have you ever done anything like meta based or like that? The only other thing I've used is redash. What did you think about that? That's pretty good. Yeah. I would like to grab my own sequel. And do it. What did you say? Back at scale. A lot. It was just like, we would, like, just build our win out of it. Oh, that's what you guys use at scale? Yeah. Redash because it's like anyone, just like you go into it. You just write SQL and then you pull together. It's like Table plus, but for dashboards. I don't know if. It's pretty good. I think that's what we need. Like a dedicated backboard because. Like this? Yeah. It's like. Okay. Here's my, like, DI perspective. Are you guys using this only internally or externally? Like, definitely internally. But, like, I just want to compare these two slides for you. One of them is literally just a chart. But it's like, if you were. If I were to show you, like, hey, like, usage is going up, what would be more effective? Showing you, like, numbers here. And I'll probably zoom in and be like, hey, here's the amount of minutes that you've spent with some sort of visual. Right now. This was pulled from post hog. We could just connect. I mean, I could just start pulling retool data and connecting it to Excel. So, like, we like this format, but can we do this in V tool? No, this was from postdoc. Can we, like, make, like, bar charts to Utah? Yeah, you can make bar charts in ritual. Probably can. I just haven't. But it's like, do we like it or you want, like, more dedicated? I don't know. Right. I think that's the question. Decide one. My personal preference is more dedicated analytics. I think the caveat is how much? Weight are we putting on presenting metrics? To clients if it's only gonna be used internally. Then I don't care. If we're hesitant to show these. Mr. I think if it's just internally. I think it still matters because how easy it is. For some effect. I actually don't know. I actually haven't used individual, but, I mean, I think I've been. Just to be fair, I'm more trying to understand the data model first. Matthew's been looking at me struggle, going through, like, some of this information where it's like. I mean, without me, without us understanding the data, it's useless. Right? So, like, I'm pulling. I'll give you an example. One of the metrics, groups of metrics that we're pulling is like, yeah, but I mean, that looks fine. That's just a query, right? But it's wrong. That's the issue. It's like, hey, client creation of folder created. I want to know, like, what's the bottleneck for someone to get technically set up visit folders? So my only. So dedicated analytics code doesn't actually solve a lot because all I know, Excel, it's gonna feed you my query. Like the setup, I'm like, is it used to figure a chart or whatever? It just prevents an extra headache at the end of the day. So, like, issue with this is like, hey, we always need someone on the data side that can help us maybe create some of these queries, but, like, our job is probably to validate them. And just for you guys, just, you know, if you got into retold, if you want to just do this, if you type in, like, chart, Bar chart and then do the same. Maybe that. Maybe once. Seems like maybe if you guys come to a decision, like next week. We're seeing sometime the next week. Because sometime next week it probably meant Andrew is start mocking on the action. But if you want to fucking up whether, like eventually is going to go. If I have time or like one engineer does it talk about that later. Sometime next week is probably when Andrew's gonna start hooking stuff. Sorry, not with Mauki stuff. About movie dash. Oh, no, it'd be nice. But if you guys decide on, like, a different tool, I think sometime next week, we'll be interrupted this side. And I had. You can use that instead. And now we have everything else. Perfect. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool. The Odyssey is talk to kind of briefly about this. Is. Our analytics data is your main body. Matthew. You might have. Matthew. I'm just listening. The other thing is longer term, you might notice better last year's life. Like, you know the proper way to do product animators like events and like a different database. Yes. And so what are they trying to do that? Probably not. Maybe it's a big, big project. But, like, yeah, eventually we'll need to go to, like, a warehouse and ETL ing and the whole deal. It's also element of, like, the order we do that. This is not wasting. Because that autocorrem has been. Yes. Yeah, it's just. We'll put it this way. Like right now I'm querying on top of client objects. This is a beast of a table. Client object, vendor objects. And basis objects should not be in our query database when it comes to analytics. Okay. Oh, I see what you mean. Okay. Based objects. Oh, maybe it's not even a lot bad. Maybe it just might be a weird. That's probably where it might have to do. I don't think there's anything you all have to change in your end. I think it's worth knowing that, hey, like, we're doing the same thing. So when it comes to, like, appetite, I think there's a few different work streams involved. Of people who want to start. So I just want to highlight also you to have this Karen, Andrew and I think when Karen pulls the data, you can get us into like a data back on our pole. That's what I do. And I think from you guys, I think if sometime next week you have to decide what I have in the disc tool. I love them. Yep. That's great. Yeah. We're not. We don't mind. Yeah, makes sense. And just one question. Does the team in general have, like, a preference for, like, hey, retold retail, like, when we were like, one tour retool shop, or you might think they do. Bounty. I honestly think it's like, makers. There's tools on, like, AI Sequel. I doubt that, but everything is sequel. But I think it's just like, how hard is it to figure? Hard as a right to SQL. Is it, like, messy? I don't know. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Thank you. No, I appreciate it. Thanks, man. Awesome. Okay? Thank you. Yeah, I mean, like, thank you for including me on this. This is super helpful to just, like, get this. Yeah. I mean, I want to make sure to include you and vice versa. Cause, like, I think I see myself as a more. Like, a more technical side. People. So it's like I wanna get involved in how we think through the data and analytics around it. Right. Let me ask a question. This is something. I'm gonna float this by Mitch on one day. But I think I'll probably do is so Atlas. To me, the first again, customers are the vit. Eventually it's the whole company. But we're starting with the idea. And so what I'm thinking about doing is if you think about Atlas like a startup of its own within basis. We should be as close as possible to our customers. And so one thing I'm playing around with is the idea of, like, a customer advisory board. Of like people that work at basis. And so maybe it's like four people or something like that at the company that, like, sort of give feedback on that. Is that something that might be interesting to you? Yeah, it'd be very interesting. Okay. I think if you're looking at, like, I'm guessing you want a combination, some combination of perspective. Down. People probably like, it's not. Is this solely Di? So I'm trying to think like Di is the first customer, but eventually it's the whole company, so I don't want to only do Di. Elijah had three very different perspectives. Okay, who aren't busy. Like, you know, Chris would be great, but he's just. Sarah wants to get involved. In somewhere. Like internal project work, too. Oh, nice. And she has a lot of accounting knowledge. So in customer knowledge. That's right. Okay. Sweet. I'll start there, and then eventually I'll probably expand it and maybe we'll, like, be two people from the eye to people from other. Whatever. But, like, that could be a good place to start. Okay? Yeah, I think that's right. I think that, like, maybe Andrew as well, he's not this close to the client, but he has a lot of, like, tooling stuff. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I'm. I'm all for it. I think one of my lessons and this might even just be, like, a weekend thing. It's just like, I need, like, fully understand our data model. I'm in this same boat. It's like, it's on my list to be like, all right, I need. To just sit down. It's like one of those things where it just takes hours. Yeah, exactly. You're not gonna learn it unless you, like, actually put in the man hours and you mess with the sequel and you're playing around with it. And then, you know, I'm only saying this because, like, I really like Michael, but I think one critical point was that, like, I don't think documentation was good enough. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know if you're. If you're seeing this right now of, like, taking over some of the work. He was like an encyclopedia. The company didn't emphasize Di understanding any of this. I think they need to. Especially if we're gonna start having self service analytics tools. Yes, for sure on that. Right. If it's not gonna just be consuming it. Then absolutely. And then the other part of it is like, I don't know, or we have a company similar to this. My first company, first four years I was there, so I got a good amount of exposure. Everyone had a base level. Of SQL to be able to execute queries. That may or may not have been written by someone else. They're able to at least execute them on, like, things. Like perfect example would be creating own tasks on the back end. I should not depend on engineering for that. I should be able to have my template. And then the inputs and like, maybe a short procedure for me to do it pretty quickly. I don't think I've seen a single sword procedure since I've started. Right. It should be, like, pretty easy, where it's like, hey. Execute. P create tasks. And then with that, it would be like, Task template. Equals. I mean, literally, it might look like that. Task name. No start date. Future dates. Yes or no? Yeah. This is, like, the perfect example of a SORT procedure that we may want. This is an interesting idea. I want to see if Elijah. I mean, like, do we agree that, like, this might actually be the way where it's like, hey, like, we have these, like, queries where it's like, all we need to do is. Trying to see if he can. Hello. Okay? Actually have an interesting thought. Or perspective. Maybe this comes from retool and I'm just, like, overthinking this. And this is what retool is, but I haven't seen a single sort procedure since like start at that basis AKA. Let's say I want to create a tax from the backend. Yeah. What would be very, I think helpful is like, hey, we can execute a function called P createtasks. And then from here you put in the inputs and like, DI should be able to run this. And click enter. And it's like, hey, we have to just teach them. What are the inputs? It's like task template. You have to grab it from somewhere. Task name. You should grab them somewhere. Start date, future dates. We want it just for that period only. It's like, almost like the framework that I would use versus what we currently are doing. Yeah, that'd be great. I just want to get your turn. The easiest way to do that is through the blueprint endpoint, where it just like, literally, it's like, here's the task, here's the period of applying, where's the task? Type. If you use the blueprint endpoint. It's effectively that information. The blueprint endpoint. That's broken. Is it broken? It doesn't work well. I guess it kind of works well. Yeah. 4 what you're looking for, which is just like a generic pre task. And any sort of the blueprint endpoint is going to be the easiest route. Now, am I saying this is the best way for Di to be able to do it now? But you will notice. If you press edit. What ends up getting passed through is here's the name of the task, here's your cadence, using category. Using the script. That's used to due date. And then you can also it also will say, like, I want to create this from this period forward. That's the idea. What does this information. In the apply blueprint, there's an additional information you pass into the input rights. The period you want to use carry doesn't work. Three doesn't work. Fantastic. So you can only do it actually starting in September. For this month, October, next one. So, like, when I'm looking at, like, all of these, So Atom bar is when I created it for. Creates it based off. Yeah, it doesn't based off of September. September. Yeah, it's volume. Makes it over. Also, it makes those sense in any sentence. Right. I don't understand what's happening. And I can't really help you understand what's happening there. However that is theoretically. This is not bad, right? We've seen this. We're growing startup, all of this. By the time we hit 100 people, if it's like this. It's bad. But right now we're 30, 40. It's fine. It's just like, there are a lot of broken retool. We need to, like, go through and just figure out everything else broken. There's a lot. You know that. Anything I haven't used in the past two weeks. I expect. Past month. You know I have no custom. That's not great. It's not great. That's like, literally a quote that we use to start a work stream. Okay, but yes. Generally, that is the idea of the it is that you should be able to throw in, like, here's the information about the task. Now, how you set up this. Now, let me tell you, there's a lot better way than this whole thing. Like how I want to create this. This is a significantly better way to be like, oh, great, great. I want to make these five tasks. And just, like, build the building the blueprint, and then using it to apply. That should be different, easier. I don't know why we did it this way. So the way they do it would be like, hey, I'd pick the firm that I want it for. Let's just do it with. If you're creating for this. Yeah. Blueprint, name basis. Yes. You're gonna. Create. I import the JSON. Yeah. Yes. Sorry. I did this right now. And I think. Is there actual code that writes a JSON from the blueprint? How does this work? I added something here. Yes. It's one of the apps, script based. Update this. Yes. Exactly. That's the whole point of it. Go to tool. Yeah. Extension. I'm into show this one as well. Not a great process. App script. Okay, that's a new one. That's the other one. I'm not creating blueprints all that often. Who created this. I did this. It works. Very comfortable. The other thing I've done plenty of times is here's all the tasks I want to make here is kind of the parameters about it. Throw it into judgment. Use it like. Give it like. Give an example. Give it like task library. It has to be upgraded for me. I've done that before. Yeah, I think part of it is just understanding the data. I'll show you an example. Here. I'm like. I was trying to create a. So I'm starting to go through, by the way, and, like, create some of the metrics. I'm on number two. And give you a perfect example. Of where things go wrong here. So I was looking at few of these books High creation of folder created cross group 912. 912 that's wrong. You know why that's wrong? Crops group was an essential one. None of the Ascend people actually created a folder, so I go into connected folder. And we have these folders. I'm like, what are these? Is connected folders the wrong folder to look at when it comes to a new folder. You see what I'm saying? Connected. I just checked it. Yeah. I don't know why craft group's not showing up right now. Oh, I added myself. So it's not. So. It's like, I don't know what all of these are. You probably have seen some of these before. Yeah, but you're looking for is the folder on the accounting book table. It's on the accounting book table. And then you're looking for. Books. Is that what it is? What you see is. There is. Group connected folder id. That's where you're looking for. What does that have on? Okay. You think we need to query versions for that when you. See one not valuable. One question is, do you think we need to, like, have. So they have a different work stream? Walter Connor and Andrew around. Metrics for workspace. I think we need, like, an engineering resource on this. If you don't have time. To, like, help me create a lot of these. To be honest. Me creating someone like the difference between Ukraine and the geeking, all of them. Is very. Like, just on the actual. Like, I don't have knowledge like this. Right. That's where it is. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'm happy to describe, like, where that information is forward a little bit. And Tanya obviously is gonna continue to like Sarah's right. In fact, with time, your data is wrong, right? In some cases. It's great for what it is. I don't even know where the timing, context. I don't want to connect to divergence because it'll take forever to run right. Try it. None of you looking at the versions of just an individual. It's a good question. And I don't know how to get up that. Okay? Cool. Yeah, Somewhere in the Tanya context is like before you ever query merchants, limit the query before you join inversions. But yes. Version is massively version should not be used. Well, scenario that's through your time at it. Should not be used for analytics. That's true. However, some of the. Yeah. Should be a view on hyper versions. That removes a lot of the product. That also? I don't know. Yeah, you virtualized view for certain things. That means. The good news is we got six of seven, Einstein. Now. Let's go. And six of seven laws or sorry. Is connected. We are 65% through anything that's dependent on the client. For deployment readiness. We have, like, a little tracker. Have you seen Elisha? You've probably seen it. So here's our tracker for nice. Lmc. So here's our tracker for lmc. We have this, like, client initial setup. So these four columns. Are kind of on the client. So here are the things that we need from them. We need the entity created. Ledger created. Financial institutions connected in monthly checklists, received. Because once you have their checklists, we can set them up on our end. We're doing it for them on this one. It's only seven clients. Financial institutions. Connected. This is the only one that we're really remaining. Ledgers? No. And C. So it's just one of the clients, but she also has two. And she's already done it. For once, she knows how to do it. Nice. So these are, like, the things that. And I can. I can slow down. No, this is helpful. These are the things I look for, and these are the things that we're using. To define the metrics that we are seeing. On like what's possible. Nice. Super helpful. Yeah, we're 64% through. Nice. That's great. Cool. Okay? See. So if this doesn't work. I mean, I think we're gonna cut it. I'll continue working on it. This is just a replacement for retool at this point. Short procedure thing. It's not a worth. It's not worth digging into. It would be nice to have that on the back end and have a different front ending. Retool. For some of this. How have the other stuff regarding our atlas been going? How's it been? This is your second week. This is week two. Oh, dude. So early. I feel that, which is like, man, I really wanna, like, get the ball rolling, but I'm still just taking in context. It's like, it's hard to do stuff until you actually know what's going on. I still feel like I'm bad at my shop. Right? I think it takes, like, a few months to. A few months. And I'm so used to. I was just like at my company before I was the one that had the most knowledge of anyone because I've been doing it for longest. It's very weird to be like have the least hundred of anyone. You came in as you were a co founder of company. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. So, like, yeah, I built all the. Like, I built it, you know, all the things from scratch. You just know it, you know? Probably so fun, though. It is fun, but present cons, Definitely pros and cons. But it is nice to feel like you know everything about a certain process to see one that's growing. Exactly. So, anyway, I'll just say that, like, right now, I'm just trying to lay the groundwork a bit. I wish I had gotten further along this week. You know, I thought I'd be a little further, but hopefully next week. Make some progress. Yeah. That makes sense. But, yeah, this is super helpful. I have some good notes. I'm glad that's a good idea to think of, Walter. By the way, this is gonna take forever because probably connecting versions. That's literally what's happening right now. It's been running for three minutes.
